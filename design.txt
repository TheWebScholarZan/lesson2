before the video:

Baseball game:
Objects: Team(s), Field, Scoreboard
states of objects:

Team: Roster, Name, Color, Location, Aberviation
Field: Defender and Offense, who is on the field and where, Bases, Pitcher and Hitter are important roles for the player to play
Scoreboard: Innings top and bottom,Score (Runs), Outs, Balls and Stikes and maybe stats of players but that maybe a roster issue like RBIs On Base hits, Stike outs, strikes for ptichers

Roster: Players name number role and stats, i think the players would have the most information 

Verbs; Hitting, Pitching, Running, Stealing, Scoring, Catching, Tagging out I think those will be the big info for how to make methods
Pitching could have various pitches, slider, curve, fast, sinker, knuckle that would and 9 different locations to throw to in the zone to make it difficutl to have the batter hits
like comapre pertentages of that batters
